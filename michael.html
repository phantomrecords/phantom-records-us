<h1>Michael — The One You're Looking For from Dream Singles</h1>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you found me, finally. This is for Dream Singles members trying to find me to strike up a conversation that isn't a) censored, b) copied and kept by third parties, hence, private, and c) billed to me as a man just because I'm a man which is discrimination in the United States. I'm a U.S. Citizen. We don't tolerate bigotry, discrimination based on gender, or race, or scams.
</p>

<p>
What does all of that in the first paragraph mean? It means I won't talk to you for an extended period of time on Dream Singles, paying that site per letter (message) to send you letters, while you pay nothing at all. It's sexist.
</p>

<p>
If you're as serious as you claim to be, send me a text or call me, because this isn't a game for me, and Dream Singles is a game. It's an entertainment website intended to entertain men who are lonely. I'm not lonely. I'm not entertained there. Because my dating life is not a game.
</p>

<p>
Now that you know, you can presume that I've blocked you on Dream Singles. So I don't have to waste time reading messages from a woman who is only on Dream Singles because she's bored or looking for a Sugar Daddy.
