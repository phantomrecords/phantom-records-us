I have had my personal belongings illegally taken under the guise of the perpetrator having no choice. I want my items paid for or returned in the same condition they were in or I want compensation to re-buy them, an apology in writing, a confession that it was done in malice, and a rescission of the lie that led law enforcement to suspect me of wrongdoing in my tenancy with the other roommates who are took possession of my belongings and used their acting skills to lie convincingly to the law enforcement. Making them discredit my version of the story which is the true version.
