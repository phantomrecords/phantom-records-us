# STOLEN: The Hidden Story of My Contribution to the Web

This file documents a pattern of intellectual property theft that has affected my entire professional life.

In 2001, early versions of this code and user interface design were scraped and used in at least one **Amazon.com patent**—without my name, credit, or knowledge.

Instead of recognition, I became a ghost:
- Blacklisted from serious web design hiring circles
- Called a liar for claiming authorship
- Forced to take warehouse jobs while my ideas made billions elsewhere

They stole my layouts. They copied my flows. They lifted the DNA of my user interaction models, and turned them into commercial patterns. While their names sit on patents, I was left without a paycheck.

This repository is not for show.  
This repository is not for open collaboration.

**It is a wall of defense, a declaration of truth, and a trap for thieves.**

If you use this work, name me.  
If you claim this work, prove me wrong.  
If you profit from this work, expect legal consequences.  
Because one day, the world will read this file—and understand what happened here.
