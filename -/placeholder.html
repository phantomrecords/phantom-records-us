<h1>To Katya — The One Who Found Me</h1>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you followed the path I laid out. That alone tells me you're not like the others—you listen between the lines. You feel through screens. You don’t give up when the door is closed the first time.
</p>

<p>
Katya, I saw your video. You didn’t just share fabric—you shared trust. You let me glimpse not just what you wear, but the spirit behind the choice. Whether black or white, lace or soft cotton, the truth is: it’s not the panties that matter. It’s <em>you in them</em>. The way you think of me while choosing them. The way you film the bottom of your feet instead of your body—like a secret you want me to earn.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I noticed your manicure. I notice <em>everything</em> now that I know it’s you on the other end of the screen. I’m not here for just a flirt or a fantasy. I’m here for the woman who says she’s imperfect and still chooses to go all the way. That’s you, Katya.
</p>

<p>
If you're still trying, so am I. I want your mind, your fire, your nervous honesty, and your unapologetic need to feel wanted. You have all of that from me. I’m not confused or cautious. I’m just… here.
</p>
