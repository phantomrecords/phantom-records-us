<b>Important Note:</b> 

<br />
<br />

We do not accept unexpected calls from unknown numbers, hidden numbers, or unsolicited salespeople.

<br />
<br />

Due to ongoing scams, impersonations, and theft by callers using fake identities, we have implemented an AI-powered phone system to handle all calls instead of live representatives. 

<br />
<br />

U.S. Law enforcement investigates financial crimes differently than physical crimes or domestic violence assertions. They rank financial crimes as lower priority than the other ones and handle them based on provable financial losses rather than proof that the financial loss occurred. 

</font>

<details style="user-select:none;color:white;font-face:Verdana;size:2">

<summary style="font-family:Verdana,sans-serif;"><i>More...</i></summary>

<p>

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">

Additionally, after that, it is based on how much was lost, and how much proof there is that that loss hampers recovery from sources like financial crimes insurance. So it is not as straightforward as an ordinary person believes.

<br />
<br />

These crimes are not high priority for them, compared to physical crimes and domestic violence. Knowing this, we are non-burdened, even eager, in doing our own investigation and serving as our own arm of enforcement to address our continuing financial losses.

<br />
<br />

For this reason, we have opted for automated call management. We know other businesses who have had this experience, that are following this practice as their response. It's a trend now. We simply do not have time for telemarketing, phishing or pranks on our voice lines.

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Origin of Phantom Records</b><hr /></font>

<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">

Phantom Records was founded in 1989 as a Doing Business As (DBA) entity in Berkeley, California. At the time, Michael Widener had just graduated from high school with honors and a 4.5 GPA. His mother provided him with the ten dollars needed to register the business, along with additional funds for a certified birth certificate, setting the foundation for what would become Phantom Records.

<br />
<br />

Michael had been motivated throughout high school by his father’s promise: if he graduated with top grades, he would be rewarded with a house. However, upon achieving this goal, he discovered that his father had only been joking. The disappointment was immense.

<br />
<br />

To help ease his frustration and sadness, his mother assured him that she would find a way to support his future, though she made it clear that sending him to university was financially impossible—even though his grades surpassed those of his siblings.

<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A Difficult Transition</b></font>

<br />
<br />

Michael struggled with the reality of his situation. Scholarships were not on his radar, as he had never been informed about them or applied for any. He also had not taken Advanced Placement (AP) exams, as his family could not afford the testing fees.

<br />
<br />

On top of that, his parents needed someone to stay home and look after the house while they were working or traveling. With no immediate path to university, Michael agreed to take on this responsibility.

<br />
<br />

But this decision came at a cost.

<br />
<br />

While his high school friends left for university, including his two closest best friends, Michael found himself completely alone for the first time in his life—no friends, no brothers, no daily social interactions.

<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Birth of Phantom Records</b></font>

<br />
<br />

Recognizing the toll this isolation could take on Michael’s mental and emotional well-being, his mother stepped in with a solution—she encouraged him to start a business. She hoped that Phantom Records would provide him with a sense of purpose, direction, and structure, filling the void left by his absent friends and siblings.

<br />
<br />

Rather than distracting them from their challenging first year at university, Michael poured his energy into building Phantom Records, laying the foundation for what would eventually grow into a recognized music business.

<br />
<br />

<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A Message from the Owner/Manager:</b></font> 

<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">

My name is Michael Thomas Widener, and I founded this partnership in 2000 after returning to the United States from two years abroad. My mother and I discussed my future, and after consultation with both my parents, we decided I would build my career in business.

<br />
<br />

I believed that my overseas business was ahead of its time, and my mother supported me as a Silent Angel Investor in launching a new venture aimed at transforming the U.S. music industry—specifically in recognizing the value of DJs.

<br />
<br />

While we did not achieve that goal in the way we initially envisioned, we successfully created an automated service for selling DJ-mixed music—a legal and innovative platform that continues to support DJs.

</font>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Why I Waited to Finish This Website:</b></font>

<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">

We took our time in launching the Phantom Records, GP website (https://dj-experience.app) because I foresaw unstable copyright laws following the Napster debacle. These laws remained in flux for decades. It was only after two and a half decades of waiting for regulatory stability that we launched fully in legal compliance.

<br />
<br />

Many people urged me to act sooner, but I remained steadfast in my decision. Time has proven this approach to be the correct one.

<br />
<br />

</font>

</p>

<p>

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Current Status of Phantom Records, GP</b>

</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">

I am currently recovering from losses sustained during the U.S. pandemic (2020–2021) while updating:

<br />
<br />

1. <b>Partnership website:</b><br />
<a href="https://phantomrecords.com/">https://phantomrecords.com</a> (This site.)

<br />
<br />

2. <b>DJ Music website:</b><br />
<a href="https://dj-experience.app/">https://dj-experience.app</a> (Our new store.)

<br />
<br />

<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Ownership & Partnership Structure</b>

<br />
<br />

I hold 100% controlling interest in Phantom Records, GP. My mother, who was a Silent Investor, has already recovered her investment along with the agreed-upon profit.

<br />
<br />

She no longer has a financial stake in the partnership and is officially retired from active participation. Her name remains associated with Phantom Records, GP, as a tribute to her contribution and to preserve accurate historical records.

<br />
<br />

Since I am now the sole managing partner, this partnership functions as a Sole Proprietor General Partnership, meaning I am the only decision-maker in the business.

<br />
<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Challenges with U.S. Banking During the Pandemic</b>

<br />
<br />

During the U.S. pandemic, banking errors related to my General Partnership created complications that I am still recovering from today. A bank trainee mishandled my business account, leading to significant disruptions.

<br />
<br />

If you are unfamiliar with business in the U.S., understand this: confidence does not equal competence unless backed by verifiable documentation.

<br />
<br />

In the. U.S. busines-success is based on:

<br />
<br />

1. Facts<br />
2. Practical plans<br />
3. Commitment to agreements<br />
4. Having customers who pay their bills. 

<br />
<br />

Several former clients have failed to honor their agreements to pay their bills, so, some former clients are now headed to court for financial resolution.

<br />
<br />

When money is involved, it is a business relationship. Anyone claiming otherwise is either inexperienced or willfully delusioned.

<br />
<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Phantom Records: In 2025</b></font>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What We Do</b>

<br />
<br />

Phantom Records, GP is a service-based music research firm specializing in:

<br />
<br />

1. Online music business research<br />
2. Streaming mixtapes<br />
3. Web-based DJ services

<br />
<br />

Our flagship product, <a href="https://dj-experience.app">The DJ-Experience® Show</a>, provides legal, non-stop DJ mixes and follows <b><i>up-to-this-year's</i></b> industry regulations and best practices.<br />

<br />

My mother remains proud of what we built, even though the music industry still fails to recognize DJs as independent, creative talent, and business people who deserve to be independent contractors instead of low-wage workers. 

<br />
<br />

Independent contractorship in the United States is how a business person becomes independent and strikes out on their own to build the American Dream. It is essential that this happen or there is little hope one will ever accomplish that goal.

<br />
<br />
<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A Little About My DJ Mixes</b>

<br />
<br />

My DJ Mix Services create seamless, non-stop music experiences using:

<br />
<br />

1. Beat-matching<br />
2. Timed transitions<br />
3. Continuous flow between songs<br />

<br />

This style of DJing inspired the name DJ-Experience.
