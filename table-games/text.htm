<b>How Copyrights Affect Mixtapes</b><br>
<br>
Making mixtapes amounts to copying your own music and listening to it on CD or tape. Once you purchase a CD or music collection you essentially purchase the right to listen to that music in any format. You can copy the music, rearrange singles, or even create new CDs or tapes of your favorite songs from a variety of different albums. This is not an uncommon practice since consumers rarely enjoy every single song on a CD and often wish to integrate their favorite songs into a separate collection.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Our service does this for you with the quality of a DJ-mixed performance. You pick the songs and the order you want them to play, and we mix them. To comply with copyright law, we have you upload your Mp3s to our system, so we can use your music collection as the source for your mix CD. This means you are using your collection, which is fair and legal. If we were to sell mixes that included songs you didn't already own, we would need a license. We don't have this presently, so we do not offer those kind of products. We hope to do this some time in the
future.<br>
<br>
After we make a CD for you, you can save your Mp3s for another mix or delete them from our system. You will receive a CD professionally decorated complete with quality colorful label, colorful jewel case, and a receipt for your purchase.&nbsp;<br>
