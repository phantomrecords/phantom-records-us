<b>Mix Tapes</b><br>
<br>
A mix tape (commonly the two words are stuck together as mixtape), or mixed tape, is a homemade compilation of songs (typically copyrighted pop music taken from another source) recorded in a specific order. It is generally used at private locations as a
soundtrack to social events, working out, driving, or dates.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Compilations</b><br>
<br>
A compilation is a collection of songs put together by a recording company for sale at retail. They bring less attention to the person who chose the songs (the compiler) and more to the genre or time period of the music included. Although their popularity is not in debate, nothing meets the needs of a
music listener better than a tape they make on their own.&nbsp;<br>

<b> Phantom Records</b><br>
<br>
Our specialty is in making DJ-mixed tapes based on songs you pick. In other words, we make DJ-mixed tapes as professional as retail CDs using songs you pick. They are great for family events and weddings or schools' dances and sports. If you buy music you know the problem in finding albums with the right mix. Even if you use an iPod your songs are not DJ-mixed; they play with short silences between each. Our mix is meaningful because you can make it with the songs you want without breaking the flow with
silences between each. Who better than you to mix what you want. Who better than a DJ to make your mix pause-free? Explore our site and see how easy it is. It is user-friendly and straight-forward.&nbsp;<br>
