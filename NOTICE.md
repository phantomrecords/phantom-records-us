# NOTICE: Public Declaration of Original Authorship

To whom it may concern:

The source code and user experience design patterns in this repository were conceived, coded, tested, and launched by me, **Michael Thomas Widener, II**, many years before their unauthorized appearance in commercial platforms and patent filings by third parties—including Amazon.com.

This work was **never licensed** to any company or individual. It has been **lifted without attribution**, and I have suffered professionally because of it.

I was never credited. I was never hired. I was never invited into the institutions that profited from my work. Instead, I have been treated as an outsider and accused of lying for simply asserting what I created first.

This repository exists to:
- Document the originality of my work
- Assert my rightful authorship
- Preserve my legacy in UX and interface development
- Protect this intellectual property from future theft or erasure

If you are using UX principles or interface elements that resemble this site or its historical versions, and you are unaware of their origin—**you are looking at it now.**

**I am the father of this code.**
