<h2>My Team...</h2>
<p><i>See the Names on My Team</i></p>
<p><b>Read Who's On My Team: 👇</b></p>

<p><strong>Michael Widener, II</strong> 👈 <i>That's me!</i><br>
–> Owner / Founder / Managing Partner / Inventor / Designer / Lead Investor</p>

<p>Michael is the award-winning contactless DJ behind Phantom Records and creator of 
<a href="https://dj-experience.app">The DJ-experience® Show</a> at 
<a href="https://dj-experience.app">DJ-experience.app</a>, his new app released this year. 
Known for mixing across all genres, Michael brings a passion for sound and a deep understanding of music culture to every performance. 
As the founder, he envisioned Phantom Records as a home for innovation, creativity, and remote-music-access in hospitality.</p>

<p><strong>Confidential Military Officer</strong><br>
–> 🪪 Active Investigator-Interdiction Planner</p>

<p>There's no violation against a business more egregious than a personal relationship “vindictively taking out” revenge through obsessive, compulsive behavior, untreated, while recreationally self-medicating, and sinfully, tortiously gaslighting—so much so the business almost dies an instant death! 
We take personal failings that hinder our success so seriously we simply outsourced the physical response to the physical assault we suffered. 
Legally, those things have so many hoops to go through that it takes years. 
We're patient. We'll let it happen when the paperwork says so. 
Welcome to the team, <i>Independent Contractor</i>.</p>

<p><strong>Mary Lee Widener</strong><br>
–> Passive Co-Investor</p>

<p>Mary Lee Widener, former leader of Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA), brings decades of experience in nonprofit leadership and financial stewardship. 
As the mother of Michael Widener II, she helped co-create Phantom Records as a way to offer affordable DJ entertainment to music lovers, just as her nonprofit once offered affordable housing to families across the country. 
Her investment has been returned with a 12% profit margin and she no longer actively invests, officially, but she loves her son and always does what any mother does for her child — she helps whenever she can. 
Of course, <i>she approved this message!</i></p>

<p><strong>Warren H. Widener, Sr.</strong><br>
–> Former Passive Co-Investor</p>

<p>Mary Lee’s late husband, who crossed the veil in 2013, would be proud of his son. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSExxnSbNYo/">Here on YouTube</a>, 
Captain Warren Widener 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSExxnSbNYo/">laments about his son</a>, Michael, losing the recording studio he bought him in the East Bay Hills Fire of 1991 (also referred to as the Oakland Firestorm of 1991). 
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/Warren_Widener/">Ret. Air Force Captain Warren H. Widener</a> (the first), survived by his three educated boys and his Mary Lee, is smiling down on his boys — and her — eternally. 
He planned all this! He kept it <i>top secret</i> separately with each of his boys! 
There have been a lot of competing opinions about him over the years. 
If you want to get past the noise, you can ask his son, Michael, at his 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7KpKUEhf-61VAAYviAg0Q">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>

<p>Warren H. Widener was a DJ of his own but went into the Air Force, as planned, to pay for his family and abandoned DJ-ing after high school. 
His son now carries both his father’s little-known music legacy and his mother’s well-known, respected legacy all in one. 
His mom and dad met in elementary school and were boyfriend and girlfriend since they were 15 years old, with the approval of both families. 
They were married for over 54 years, and only parted ways for tax reasons because his dad knew taxes like the back of his hand. 
They’ll always be together in Michael’s heart, and he plans to have them joined together in his church for the ages.</p>

<h3>Know Why I Do What I Do — My History</h3>
<p>Phantom Records, the DBA, was first registered 1989 in the East Bay Area of California. 
It was created as a small business after the proprietor held a few parties during his high-school years that were profitable. 
His penchant for marketing drew the attention of his parents and after graduating high school he said he wanted to go into the work as a job one day. 
After months of family meetings, his mother gave him the money to register Phantom Records. 
He was not given the choice of attending school because his family couldn’t afford to send him while his other two brothers were in school. 
So this was his compromise.</p>

<p>Learning about the music business kept him busy and eventually led to decades of research until his mother gave him the money to upgrade his business into a partnership after he proved he could run a successful startup when he broke even running an online store overseas with only $2,000 of investment. 
He ran his business overseas for two years and moved it to the United States when he returned, opening a partnership with his mother as a silent investor. 
Together they have continued as partners while he studied the industry to choose a path forward.</p>

<p>Now, in 2025, after the final tier two of the Copyright Royalty Board’s streaming rate (a tax-like amount all streams are charged when played online) became final — along with all related Federal and local guidelines — he launched his Partnership’s website with all the proper rates set to current levels, making it the only website in the U.S. (and hence the world) that follows every law and copyright guideline <i>on the books</i>.</p>

<p>To see what he sells, visit <a href="https://dj-experience.app/">https://dj-experience.app</a> — you’ll see something you’ve never seen before: a DJ-mix website that sells and streams digital mixtapes online without allowing anything to be downloaded or purchased in any physical or data format. 
The site does not allow a buyer to take anything away, which fulfills the essential goal of U.S. music laws. 
His model is the only one that fully supports this goal and has won him several awards listed below.</p>

<p>The Partnership sincerely hopes you enjoyed reading this short history.</p>

<p><b>Here are the awards:</b><br>(List of awards coming soon.)</p>

<h3>How You Contact Me — The Creator</h3>
<p>To contact the creator of Phantom Records, connect or message exclusively 
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/michael-widener-ii/">via LinkedIn.com</a>. 
(You must be a member of LinkedIn to connect; this is for security and privacy.) 
Similarly, you must have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/emailsignup/">Instagram account</a> to see 
<a href="https://help.instagram.com/369001149843369/">Instagram profiles</a>. 
We have an <a href="https://instagram.com/phantom.records.dj.mixtapes">Instagram profile</a>, and you can 
<span title="DM stands for Direct Message.">DM</span> us there if you use Instagram (though we don’t reply to every message).</p>

<p>He does not allow contact through any other means due to past experiences with scams, hacking, fake emails, phishing, and hostile cyber behavior — all of which began via email. 
The solution is to interact only with profiles from a trusted platform instead of email messages.</p>

<p>The creator’s LinkedIn profile can be accessed at 
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/michael-widener-ii/">Michael-Widener-II</a> on 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup?trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-join">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, the U.S. Pandemic burdened law enforcement enough that they no longer are required to make reports for offenses that don’t meet their criteria, so the Partnership no longer exposes itself to bad actors who exploit those unpublished new reporting criteria. 
We regret if this causes inconvenience.</p>

<h3>Read Why My DJ Mixes Are 100% Unique</h3>
<p>Our <a href="../services/">DJ Mix Services</a> blend music together into non-stop mixes that transition from song to song, creating an uninterrupted listening experience. 
No DJ mix is ever the same once recorded — even if it’s only audio. 
This requires beat-matching skill and timed transitions, giving cohesion and never stopping the music. 
Listeners often wished for shorter mixes for work breaks, which we’re now planning to provide.</p>

<p>To hear what I mean, visit a Mix Page here on Phantom Records or the 
<a href="https://dj-experience.app/view-mixes/">View Mixes</a> page at DJ-experience. 
You can also explore the <a href="../../store/">Store Page</a> for more mixes. 
After going there, click a Mixtape Album Cover, then “Audio Preview.” 
Enjoy your visit!</p>
