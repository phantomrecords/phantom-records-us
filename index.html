      <h1>This is the new Phantom Records GP.</h1>
<p>You found Phantom Records GP (Phantom Records General Partnership) explainer page. Previously, this page looked like the image below at its homepage. After months of research, and legal 'digging' I realized there are over thirty Phantom Records businesses in the United States. At least one is not filed pubically but still exists and given that this name pair is so popular that it's everywhere, it doesn't make sense to invest in giving it a visual-brand style. No one will know which Phantom Records this is because no one else will do all the 'digging' I did to find out how many there are and which one I am. So instead of that, this page is mostly text. Instead of graphics and marketing this page explains. I hope you find this change a breath of fresh air, and can appreciate that I value my time and your time, and that's why I made this change.</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">üåê</span> Phantom Records, General Partnership (Phantom Records GP)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Business Address:</code> ‚Äî 9841 Washingtonian Blvd, Suite 220 PMB 16, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878.</li>
        <li><code>Service Location:</code> ‚Äî I am a completely virtual business. I have no physical presence that is open to the public. I do not transact retail for physical products. I made this page to devle into this because no one undertands this unless I explain it.</li>
        <li><code>What it is:</code> ‚Äî Phantom Records GP is a service that researches, studies, and learns how to run an Internet-based business by keeping up with all of the U. S. laws that impact a music-related business. There are an innumerable number of laws. It is a wonder anyone wants to be in this business. I only have this business and it doesn't have any employees and it doesn't work with anyone in any capacity besides what contracts I sign. And if I have any contracts at all with anyone I'll put them here so everyone knows who is working with me. There is so much fraud and scamming on the Internet now and in Social Media and in text messages that this is the only way for anyone to know what to believe and what not to. Cyber Thieves have evolved to an unprecedented level and they are wiling to say anything to convince their targets they are legitimate. So for my partnership, Phantom Records, GP, this is the only place you can go to read what's true. This is 'ground zero.'</li>
        <li><code>Why it was made:</code> ‚Äî I made Phantom Records, GP to address a gap in legal, legitimacy for DJs. Over the years DJs were not recognized for the influence they had on music listeners and I wanted to change that. As the years progressed, the entertainment industry, not including DJs, made changes to limit DJ-ing and, in some cases, outlaw it, altogether. Those changes made it clear that the industry regards DJs as hostile. Unfortunately this drove me away from any motivattion to be part of this industry in the United States and to change my focus back to purely creating helpful services that would lead music hopefuls to the truth about DJ-related laws and DJ-related realities so that young DJs would not fall prey to ignorance and be caught in a growing net designed to drain profit and autonomy out of the DJ-ing altogether, in the United States. The United States is the only country on Earth that does this to DJs, and other countries are completely different in how the regard DJs. So this page will explain that and you'll see why it matters what you know about DJ-ing and where you choose to do it. For professional DJs who already do business here, in the U. S., they know what I'm talking about. I need not address them. I'm glad they're successful and I wish them the best fortune in maintaining their dominant relationship with their music listeners because they're life-long investment in buying music at retail prices, then playing music for listening crowds to help shape their taste, was a gift to entertainment. It's a gift that we listeners know is a gift and we will forever regard great DJs as powerful. So my Phantom Records GP is not a record label. It is not a competitor to any Record Label. It is a research operation and now you know for certain what it researches. We are not interseted in the flash, glamour, or 'bling' of entertainment. Which is why this site looks the way it look. More about this later.</li>
        <li><code>What's next:</code> ‚Äî I will continue researching and building websites related to my research. That's what's next.</li>
        <li><code>How to Contact Us:</code> ‚Äî If you don't know how to find a business' phone number then you don't need to contact that business. I stopped putting my contact information on the Internet because all I receive is a growing mountain of 'junk email' and Internet 'trolls', 'scammers' and criminals. The United States simply has terrible laws allowing anyone to dump on anyone's email address and absolutely leaves it up to the me to deal with bad actors who abuse me online. So to deal with them, this is what I'm doing: There is no contact information here that's electronic. They're on punishment. They don't even get a phone number here. In other words, even though the 'Can Spam' law exists, I won't help you abuse me.</li>
