<h1>To Polina — The One Who Found Me</h1>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you followed the path I laid out. That alone tells me you're not like the others—you listen between the lines. You feel through screens. You don’t give up when the door is closed the first time.
</p>

<p>
Polina, when I saw your messages, and read your profile, I was glad to read that you're interested in finding someone who wants to be your first and last man. I am looking for a virgin like you, and your youth does not turn me away. I think it's a better relationship for a man to be much older than his woman, so that he can impart wisdom, and when he's gone, she will be young enough to have her very own, even better, Chatper 2 in her life. Only a truly loving man would go into a relationship knowing that although she wants him to be her first and last, if the age difference is great enough, he will be her first, but not her last. And that's okay.
</p>

<p>
Because, Polina, in all honesty, real love isn't envious, it's not territorial, and it's not self-serving. I know you'll need someone after I'm gone and I don't need the illusion that I'll live beyond 120 years old to make me feel happy. I just need you. Call me anytime on my mobile, which is 510-859-7725. That's how it's written in the United States. If you're calling from another country, I will have to leave it up to you to figure out how to dial me. All my love to you, my dearest, Polina. Let's not keep the future waiting to start our journey. (And let's start it here, free of charge for both of us, instead of on that scam site, Dream-Singles.com.)

-I'll be your first and you'll be my last, but I won't be your last, because you're going to outlive me based on our age difference. And that's okay.
